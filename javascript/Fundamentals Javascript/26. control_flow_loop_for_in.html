<!-- for in loop is used to access /iterate property of an object -->
<script>
// Create Array 
const Colors=["red","blue","green","black","white","pink","orange","brown"]

//color is loop variable
for (let color of Colors) {
    
//with for of loop, no need reference array to print, loop variable willl directly have value store like simple for loop . This is the advantage of using for of over for in for array iteration

console.log(color);
