<!-- Proprtotype: means parent. For inherticance, you can use all the methods defined in parent . E.g: In console all the method defined for prototype can be used in object -->
<script>
// let x={a:1,b:2};

// // In console , it will display proto as object. Use some of its methid defined in prototype
// x.toString()
// console.log(x);

// let myArray=[];
// console.log(myArray);

// If want to define method once and use it multiple times, set prototype of object/constructor and attach the method to prototype instead of adding in object
function Circle(radius){

    // Instance member
    this.radius=radius;

}

//Set prototype of Circle and add draw method . Calles as prototype member
Circle.prototype.draw= function(){
    console.log('draw');
}

// Verify circle object , it's prototype should have draw method and it can be reused/accessed as inheritance
const c1=new Circle(2);
const c2=new Circle(3);
console.log(c1.draw());
console.log(c2.draw());
</script>
