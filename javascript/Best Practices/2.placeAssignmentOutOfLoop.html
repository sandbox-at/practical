<!-- Reduce Activity in Loops
Loops are often used in programming.

Each statement in a loop, including the for statement, is executed for each iteration of the loop.

Statements or assignments that can be placed outside the loop will make the loop run faster. -->
<!-- Do this -->
let l = arr.length;
for (let i = 0; i < l; i++) {

    <!-- Don't Do this -->
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
