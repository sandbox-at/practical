<form name="my-form">
  <div class="article">Article</div>
  <div class="long article">Long article</div>
</form>

<script>
  // find by name attribute
  let form = document.getElementsByName('my-form')[0];

  // find by class inside the form
  let articles = form.getElementsByClassName('article');
  alert(articles.length); // 2, found two elements with class "article"
</script>

<!-- By far the most used are querySelector and querySelectorAll, but getElement(s)By* can be sporadically helpful or found in the old scripts.

Besides that:

There is elem.matches(css) to check if elem matches the given CSS selector.
There is elem.closest(css) to look for the nearest ancestor that matches the given CSS-selector. The elem itself is also checked.
And let’s mention one more method here to check for the child-parent relationship, as it’s sometimes useful:

elemA.contains(elemB) returns true if elemB is inside elemA (a descendant of elemA) or when elemA==elemB. -->
