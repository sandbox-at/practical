<!-- We can also use event delegation to add “behaviors” to elements declaratively, with special attributes and classes.

The pattern has two parts:

We add a custom attribute to an element that describes its behavior.
A document-wide handler tracks events, and if an event happens on an attributed element – performs the action. -->

Counter: <input type="button" value="1" data-counter>
One more counter: <input type="button" value="2" data-counter>

<script>
  document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {

    if (event.target.dataset.counter != undefined) { // if the attribute exists...
      event.target.value++;
    }

  });
</script>
