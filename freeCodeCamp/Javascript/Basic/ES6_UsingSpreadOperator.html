<!-- In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so: -->

<!-- let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];
thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray. -->

<!-- We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) and num (a number) as arguments. The function is supposed to return a new array made up of num copies of arr. We have done most of the work for you, but it doesn't work quite right yet. Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works correctly (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!). -->

<script>

function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // Only change code below this line
     newArr.push([...arr]);
    // Only change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));

</script>

<!-- Another huge advantage of the spread operator is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple: -->
<!-- 
let thisArray = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];

let thatArray = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];
thatArray would have the value ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander']. -->
<script>
function spreadOut() {
  let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
  let sentence=['learning',...fragment,'is','fun']; // Change this line
  return sentence;
}

console.log(spreadOut());
</script>
